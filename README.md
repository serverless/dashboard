# Serverless Console

This repository is the singular location of all open-source components of [Serverless Console](https://console.serverless.com?ref_website=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fserverless%2Fconsole), our new serverless observability offering.  The intent of this repository is to be centralized, convenient and transparent.  

Here you will find:

* **Documentation** – The documentation and guides for Serverless Console.
* **AWS Lambda Extensions** – The source code of the AWS Lambda Extensions installed by users to send metrics, traces and logs to Serverless Console.
* **AWS IAM Role** – The AWS CloudFormation template containing an AWS IAM Role that allows Serverless Console permissions to specific services to provide monitoring and observability features. For more information visit the [Serverless Console Data Sources and Permissions]( https://www.serverless.com/console/docs/integrations/data-sources-and-roles) documentation.

Contributions are welcome!  If you have additional questions, please reach out to us at [contact@serverless.com](mailto:contact@serverless.com)
