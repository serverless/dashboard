# Orgs & Members

## Creating an Org

An org is a unique tenant within Serverless Console. When you sign up,
Serverless Console generates a default org name which you can change. You can
create any number of orgs. Members can be added to an org, and a member can
belong to multiple orgs.

## Adding Members

Serverless Console currently supports the following basic roles which are shared
across your org.

- **Owner** - Owner of the account. Can add other contributors and access the
Org Settings. Only one owner per account can be present.
- **Contributor** - Contributors can use all of console but can not add other
users or access the Org Settings directly.

## Changing Org name

Org names can be changed from the Org Settings section of Console. Keep in mind
that org names do need to be globally unique across Serverless, so your desired
organization name may not be available. 

## Using Serverless Dashboard Orgs

If you have an existing Serverless Dashboard org and you log into Serverless
Console you will automatically start using your existing org. Additionally if
you are a member of a Serverless Dashboard org you will automatically be made a
member of that org in  Serverless Console.
