Welcome to Serverless Console. 

A Developer focused observability platform for
teams building using Serverless Architectures.

Here's what you need to start using console.

## Sign up or Login to Serverless Console
Sign up and create your organization on [Serverless Console](https://console.serverless.com?ref_website=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.serverless.com%2Fconsole%2Fdocs%2F) (This takes 2 seconds)

## Connect your AWS Account
Login to an AWS account, and start connecting your functions. (This takes 2 minutes)

## Enable Tracing and Logs
Choose a function your working on, and start using [Dev Mode](product/logs.md#real-time-logging) to tail your logs and transactions.

To learn more about how we're collecting data from your account see our [Instrumentation Section](./instrumentation/)

Or dive in and learn more about using [Logs](./product/logs.md), [Metrics](./product/metrics.md), and [Traces](./product/traces.md) in Serverless Console.
