# @serverless/sdk

## [Serverless Console](https://www.serverless.com/console) SDK

### Use case

Environment agnostic [Serverless Console](https://www.serverless.com/console) instrumentation functions for Node.js applications.

This library is safe to use without side-effects in any Node.js applications. It becomes effective once (one of the listed below) environment specific SDK is loaded on top.

#### Environment extensions

- **AWS Lambda** - [@serverless/aws-lambda-sdk](https://github.com/serverless/console/tree/main/node/packages/aws-lambda-sdk#readme)

### Installation

```shell
npm install @serverless/sdk
```

### Usage

_CJS:_

```javascript
const serverlessSdk = require('@serverless/sdk');

// ...
serverlessSdk.captureError(new Error('Unexpected'));
```

_ESM:_

```javascript
import serverlessSdk from '@serverless/sdk';

// ...
serverlessSdk.captureError(new Error('Unexpected'));
```

### Setup

#### 1. Register with [Serverless Console](https://console.serverless.com/)

#### 2. Initialize and setup SDK specific to your enviroment

See [Environment extensions](#environment-extensions)

##### 2.1 Configuration options

_Common options supported by all environments:_

###### `SLS_ORG_ID` (or `options.orgId`)

Required setting. Id of your organization in Serverless Console.

##### `SLS_DISABLE_HTTP_MONITORING` (or `options.disableHttpMonitoring`)

Disable tracing of HTTP and HTTPS requests. See [HTTP instrumentation](docs/instrumentation/http.md)

##### `SLS_DISABLE_REQUEST_RESPONSE_MONITORING` (or `options.disableRequestResponseMonitoring`)

(Dev mode only) Disable monitoring requests and reponses (function, AWS SDK requests and HTTP(S) requests)

##### `SLS_DISABLE_EXPRESS_MONITORING` (or `options.disableExpressMonitoring`)

Disable automated express monitoring. See [express app instrumentation](docs/instrumentation/express-app.md)

##### `SLS_DISABLE_CAPTURED_EVENTS_STDOUT` (or `options.disableCapturedEventsStdout`)

Disable writing captured events registered via `.captureError` and `.captureWarning` to stdout

##### `SLS_TRACE_MAX_CAPTURED_BODY_SIZE_KB` (or `options.traceMaxCapturedBodySizeKb`)

In dev mode, HTTP request and response bodies are stored as tags. To avoid performance issues, bodies that extend 10 000KB in size are not exposed. This default can be overridden with this settin

### Instrumentation

This package comes with instrumentation for following areas.

_Note: instrumentation is enabled via environment specific SDK instance, relying just on `@serverless/sdk` doesn't enable any instrumentation)_

- [HTTP(s) requests](docs/instrumentation/http.md)
- [express app](docs/instrumentation/express-app.md)
- [Node.js console](docs/instrumentation/node-console.md)
